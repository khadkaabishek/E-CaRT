🌟 Day 64 of Learning 🌟
Today was all about Dockerizing my project and tackling the various challenges that came with it. 🐳💻 Although I encountered a bunch of problems, facing them head-on made me feel more confident and skilled in managing containerized environments.

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Set up Docker containers to run the frontend with Vite, exposing ports and mounting volumes correctly.
2. Troubleshot Docker crashes and learned useful commands to restart and reset containers smoothly.
3. Configured environment variables for the containerized app to work seamlessly across different environments.
4. Worked on optimizing the Vite config and Dockerfile for faster development and rebuilds.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Gained hands-on experience with Docker container lifecycle and debugging.
✔️ Learned how to keep development environments consistent using Docker volumes and env vars.
✔️ Improved understanding of integrating frontend tools like Vite inside Docker.
✔️ Developed resilience by embracing and solving deployment problems directly.

Overcoming these Docker challenges really boosted my confidence with devops workflows! 🚀🐋
