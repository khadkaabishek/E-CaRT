🌟 Day 63 of Learning 🌟
Today was all about refining the seller-side analytics to better understand 
individual product performance over time. 🛍️📈 I worked on displaying clear, 
meaningful product-wise insights using pie charts and ensured backend logic 
stays in sync with real-time inventory data.

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Transformed order data to render individual product contributions in a pie
   chart using `recharts`.
2. Built a clean backend API (`/analyze/:id`) to serve seller-specific order 
   analysis.
3. Fixed the backend logic to reduce `quantityAvailable`  for each product a-
   fter a successful order placement — keeping inventory accurate.
4. Tweaked chart rendering for better visual clarity and more useful labeling.

✅ Summary:

✔️ Sellers can now see how much each product contributes to total sales.
✔️ API returns structured and pre-processed data for direct chart integration.
✔️ Inventory is automatically updated after each order, preventing over-selling.
✔️ Analytics visuals are now cleaner, more intuitive, and insightful.

Turning raw backend data into clear visual stories is becoming my favorite part 
of full-stack dev! 🧠📊
